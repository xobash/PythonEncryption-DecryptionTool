# Simple Plaintext Encryption/Decryption Program by xobash

This is a simple Python program that implements plaintext encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the tkinter library for user interaction.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext messages using the Caesar Cipher with a customizable shift value.
- Decrypt encrypted messages using the Caesar Cipher with the same shift value used for encryption.
- User-friendly GUI for inputting plaintext, viewing encrypted/decrypted text, and interacting with encryption/decryption functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the program by executing `python caesar_cipher_gui.py` in your terminal.

## Usage

1. Enter your plaintext message in the "Cleartext" entry field.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message using the Caesar Cipher.
3. The encrypted message will appear in the "Encrypted text" entry field.
4. To decrypt an encrypted message, paste it into the "Encrypted text" entry field.
5. Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the message using the Caesar Cipher.
6. The decrypted message will appear in the "Output" entry field.

## Customize Encryption/Decryption

You can customize the shift value used for encryption and decryption by modifying the `shift` variable in the code. By default, the program uses a shift value of 3.
